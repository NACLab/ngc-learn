"""
Routines and co-routines for ngc-learn's differential equation integration backend.

Currently supported back-end forms of integration in ngc-learn include:
0) Euler integration (RK-1);
1) Midpoint method (RK-2);
2) Heun's method (error-corrector RK-2);
3) Ralston's method (error-corrector RK-2);
4) 4th-order Runge-Kutta method (RK-4);
