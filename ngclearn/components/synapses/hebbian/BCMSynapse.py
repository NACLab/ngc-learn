class BCMSynapse(DenseSynapse): # BCM-adjusted synaptic cable
    """
    A synaptic cable that adjusts its efficacies in accordance with BCM
    (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro) theory.

    Mathematically, a synaptic update performed according to BCM theory is:
    | tau_w d(W_{ij})/dt = -w_decay W_{ij} + x_j * [y_i * (y_i - theta_i)] / theta_i
    | tau_theta d(theta_i)/dt = -theta_i + <(y_i)^2>_{batch}
    | where x_j is the pre-synaptic input, y_i is the post-synaptic output

    Note that, in most literature related to BCM, the average value used for
    threshold `theta` can be assumed to be the average over all input patterns
    (as in a full dataset batch update) but a temporal average maintained for
    `theta` will "usually be equivalent" (and ngc-learn implements the threshold
    `theta` in terms of a leaky ODE to dynamically compute the temporal mean).
