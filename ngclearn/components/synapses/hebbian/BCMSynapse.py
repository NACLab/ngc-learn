class BCMSynapse(DenseSynapse): # BCM-adjusted synaptic cable
    """
    A synaptic cable that adjusts its efficacies in accordance with BCM
    (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro) theory.

    Mathematically, a synaptic update performed according to BCM theory is:
    | tau_w d(W_{ij})/dt = -w_decay W_{ij} + x_j * [y_i * (y_i - theta_i)] / theta_i
    | tau_theta d(theta_i)/dt = -theta_i + <(y_i)^2>_{batch}
    | where x_j is the pre-synaptic input, y_i is the post-synaptic output

    Note that, in most literature related to BCM, the average value used for
    threshold `theta` can be assumed to be the average over all input patterns
    (as in a full dataset batch update) but a temporal average maintained for
    `theta` will "usually be equivalent" (and ngc-learn implements the threshold
    `theta` in terms of a leaky ODE to dynamically compute the temporal mean).

    | --- Synapse Compartments: ---
    | inputs - input (takes in external signals)
    | outputs - output signals (transformation induced by synapses)
    | weights - current value matrix of synaptic efficacies
    | key - JAX PRNG key
    | --- Synaptic Plasticity Compartments: ---
    | pre - pre-synaptic signal/value to drive 1st term of BCM update (x)
    | post - post-synaptic signal/value to drive 2nd term of BCM update (y)
    | theta - synaptic modification threshold (post-synaptic) variables
    | dWeights - current delta matrix containing changes to be applied to synapses

    Args:
        name: the string name of this cell

        shape: tuple specifying shape of this synaptic cable (usually a 2-tuple
            with number of inputs by number of outputs)

        tau_w: synaptic update time constant

        tau_theta: threshold variable evolution time constant

        theta0: initial condition for synaptic modification threshold

        w_bound: maximum value to enforce over newly computed efficacies
            (default: 0.); must > 0. to be used

        w_decay: synaptic decay factor (default: 0.)

        weight_init: a kernel to drive initialization of this synaptic cable's values;
            typically a tuple with 1st element as a string calling the name of
            initialization to use

        resist_scale: a fixed scaling factor to apply to synaptic transform
            (Default: 1.), i.e., yields: out = ((W * Rscale) * in)

        p_conn: probability of a connection existing (default: 1.); setting
            this to < 1. will result in a sparser synaptic structure
