    | --- Synapse Compartments: ---
    | inputs - input (takes in external signals)
    | outputs - output signal (transformation induced by synapses)
    | weights - current value matrix of synaptic efficacies
    | key - JAX RNG key
    | --- Synaptic Plasticity Compartments: ---
    | preSpike - pre-synaptic spike to drive 1st term of STDP update (takes in external signals)
    | postSpike - post-synaptic spike to drive 2nd term of STDP update (takes in external signals)
    | preTrace - pre-synaptic trace value to drive 1st term of STDP update (takes in external signals)
    | postTrace - post-synaptic trace value to drive 2nd term of STDP update (takes in external signals)
    | dWeights - current delta matrix containing changes to be applied to synaptic efficacies

    Args:
        name: the string name of this cell

        shape: tuple specifying shape of this synaptic cable (usually a 2-tuple
            with number of inputs by number of outputs)

        eta: global learning rate

        lmbda: controls degree of synaptic disconnect ("lambda")

        weight_init: a kernel to drive initialization of this synaptic cable's values;
            typically a tuple with 1st element as a string calling the name of
            initialization to use

        resist_scale: a fixed scaling factor to apply to synaptic transform
            (Default: 1.), i.e., yields: out = ((W * Rscale) * in) + b

        p_conn: probability of a connection existing (default: 1.); setting
            this to < 1. will result in a sparser synaptic structure
