    An abstract base for monitors for both ngclearn and ngclava. Compartments

    `advance_state` loops automatically.

    Using default window length:
        myMonitor << myComponent.myCompartment

    Using custom window length:
        myMonitor.watch(myComponent.myCompartment, customWindowLength)

    To get values out of the monitor either path to the stored value
    directly, or pass in a compartment directly. All
    paths are the same as their local path variable.

    Using a compartment:
        myMonitor.view(myComponent.myCompartment)

    Using a path:
        myMonitor.get_store(myComponent.myCompartment.path).value

    There can only be one monitor in existence at a time due to the way it
    interacts with resolvers and the compilers
    for ngclearn.
