<b>ngc-learn</b> is a Python library for building, simulating, and analyzing
biomimetic systems, neurobiological agents, spiking neuronal networks,
predictive coding circuitry, and models that learn via biologically-plausible
forms of credit assignment. This simulation toolkit is built on top of JAX and is
distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

It is currently maintained by the
<a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/nac_lab.html">Neural Adaptive Computing (NAC) laboratory</a>.

## Installation

### Dependencies

ngc-learn requires:
1) Python (>=3.10)
2) NumPy (>=1.26.0)
3) SciPy (>=1.7.0)
4) ngcsimlib (>=0.3.b2), (visit official page <a href="https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-sim-lib">here</a>)
5) JAX (>= 0.4.18) (to enable GPU use, make sure to install one of the CUDA variants)
<!--
5) scikit-learn (>=1.3.1) if using `ngclearn.utils.density`
6) matplotlib (>=3.4.3) if using `ngclearn.utils.viz`
6) networkx  (>=2.6.3) (currently optional but required if using `ngclearn.utils.experimental.viz_utils`)
7) pyviz (>=0.2.0) (currently optional but required if using `ngclearn.utils.experimental.viz_utils`)
-->

---
ngc-learn 1.2.beta0 and later require Python 3.10 or newer as well as ngcsimlib >=0.3.b3.
ngc-learn's plotting capabilities (routines within `ngclearn.utils.viz`) require
Matplotlib (>=3.8.0) and imageio (>=2.31.5) and both plotting and density estimation
tools (routines within ``ngclearn.utils.density``) will require Scikit-learn (>=0.24.2).
Many of the tutorials will require Matplotlib (>=3.8.0), imageio (>=2.31.5), and Scikit-learn (>=0.24.2).

### User Installation

<i>Setup</i>: The easiest way to install ngc-learn is through <code>pip</code>:
<pre>
$ pip install ngclearn
</pre>

Note that installing the official pip package without any form of JAX installed
on your system will default to downloading the CPU version of ngc-learn; make
sure you have installed the Cuda 12 version of Jax/Jaxlib on your system before
running the above pip command if you want to use the GPU version.

The documentation includes more detailed
<a href="https://ngc-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html">installation instructions</a>.
Note that this library was developed on Ubuntu 20.04 and tested on Ubuntu(s) 18.04 and 20.04.

If the installation was successful, you should see the following if you test
it against your Python interpreter, i.e., run the <code>$ python</code> command
and complete the following sequence of steps as depicted in the screenshot below
(you should see at the bottom of your output something akin to the
right major and minor version of ngc-learn):

```console
Python 3.11.4 (main, MONTH  DAY YEAR, TIME) [GCC XX.X.X] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import ngclearn
>>> ngclearn.__version__
'1.2b0'
```

<i>Note:</i> For access to the previous Tensorflow-2 version of ngc-learn (of
which we no longer support), please visit the repo for
