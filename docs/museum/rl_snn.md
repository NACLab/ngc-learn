# Reinforcement Learning through a Spiking Controller

In this exhibit, we will see how to construct a simple biophysical model for 
reinforcement learning with a spiking neural network and modulated 
spike-timing-dependent plasticity. 
This model incorporates a mechanisms from several different models, including 
the constrained RL-centric SNN of <b>[1]</b> as well as the simplifications 
made with respect to the model of <b>[2]</b>. The model code for this
exhibit can be found
[here](https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-museum/tree/main/exhibits/rl_snn).
