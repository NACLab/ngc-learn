# Hierarchical Predictive Coding (Rao &amp; Ballard)

In this exhibit, we create, simulate, and visualize the
internally acquired receptive fields of the predictive coding model originally proposed in (Rao &amp; Ballard, 1999) [1].

The model code for this
exhibit can be found
[here](https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-museum/tree/main/exhibits/pc_recon).
