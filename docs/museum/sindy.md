# Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamical Systems (SINDy)[1]

In this section, we teach, create, simulate, and visualize SINDy model implemented in NGC-Learn library. After going through this demonstration, you will:

1.  Learn how to build a SINDy model of time-series dataset, generated using Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) of known dynamical systems used in [1].
2.  Learn how to build polynomial libraries of given dataset with arbitrary order.
3.  Learn how to solve the sparse regression problem by iteratively performing the least squares (LSQ) method followed by thresholding-- Sequential Thresholding Least Square (STLSQ)-- for the given model.

The model **code** for this exhibit can be found [here](https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-museum/exhibits/sindy/sindy.py).


## SINDy 
SINDy is a data-driven algorithm that discovers the differential equation governing the dynamical systems. It uses symbolic regression to identify differential equation of the system and it solves sparse regression over the pre-defined library of candidate terms. It takes time series gathered dataset of the system and it gives you its describing differential equation.

### Inputs
> Time: $ts = [t_0, t_1, \dots,  T]$
> State matrix: $\mathbf{X}_{(m \times n)}$  (t measurements of n variables)

### Inputs

   **Time**
* $ts = [t_0,~t_1, \dots,~T]$
  
   **State matrix**
* $\mathbf{X}(t)_{(m \times n)} = [x(t),~~y(t),~~z(t)]$





Given a set of time-series measurements of a dynamical system state variables ($\mathbf{X}_{(m \times n)}$) we construct:






### Data Matrix

Given a set of time-series measurements of a dynamical system state variables ($\mathbf{X}_{(m \times n)}$) we construct:
Derivative matrix: $\dot{\mathbf{X}}_{(m \times n)}$ (computed numerically)

Library of Candidate Functions: $\Theta(\mathbf{X}) = [\mathbf{1} \quad \mathbf{X} \quad \mathbf{X}^2 \quad \mathbf{X}^3 \quad \sin(\mathbf{X}) \quad \cos(\mathbf{X}) \quad ...]$

SINDy describes the derivative (linear operation acting on â–³t) as linear transformations
of a manually constructed dictionary from the state vector by a coefficient matrix.
Dictionary learning combined with LASSO (L1-norm) promotes the sparsity of the coefficient matrix
which allows only governing terms in the dictionary stay non-zero.
