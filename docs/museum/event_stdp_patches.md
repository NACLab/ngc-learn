# Event-based Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Tavanaei et al.; 2018)

In this exhibit, we create, simulate, and visualize the internally acquired receptive fields of the spiking neural 
network (SNN) trained via event-based spike-timing-dependent plasticity (EV-STDP) over image patches. This 
reproduces the SNN model originally proposed in (Tavanaei et al., 2018) [1].

The model code for this exhibit can be found 
[here](https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-museum/tree/main/exhibits/evstdp_patches).
