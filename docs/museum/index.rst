Model Exhibits
==============

Models are presented in ngc-learn's model museum in the form of "exhibits", which are effectively model-specific
walkthroughs and analyses, based on the relevant, referenced publicly available ngc-learn simulation code. (Note that
there are more model exhibits in the actual `museum repository <https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-museum>`_ than the number
of detailed walkthroughs presented in the table of contents below.)
