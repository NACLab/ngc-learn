# Excitatory-Inhibitory Recurrent Neural Network (Song et al.; 2016)

In this exhibit, we create, simulate, and visualize the dynamics and adaptation of the excitatory-inhibitory 
recurrent neural network (EI-RNN) originally proposed in (Song et al., 2016) [1]. 

The model code for this exhibit can be found 
[here](https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-museum/tree/main/exhibits/ei_rnn).
