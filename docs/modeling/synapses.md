# Synapses

The synapse is a key building blocks for connecting/wiring together the various
component cells that one would use for characterizing a biomimetic neural system.
These particular objects are meant to perform, per simulated time step, a
specific type of transformation -- such as a linear transform or a 
convolution -- utilizing their underlying synaptic parameters.
Most times, a synaptic cable will be represented by a set of matrices (or filters) 
that are used to conduct a projection of an input signal (a value presented to a
pre-synaptic/input compartment) resulting in an output signal (a value that
appears within one of its post-synaptic compartments). Notably, a synapse component is
typically associated with a local plasticity rule, e.g., a Hebbian-type
update, that either is triggered online, i.e., at some or all simulation time
steps, or by integrating a differential equation, e.g., via eligibility traces.

## Non-Plastic Synapse Types

### Static (Dense) Synapse

This synapse performs a linear transform of its input signals.
Note that this synaptic cable does not evolve and is meant to be 
used for fixed value (dense) synaptic connections.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.StaticSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

### Static Convolutional Synapse

This synapse performs a convolutional transform of its input signals.
Note that this synaptic cable does not evolve and is meant to be 
used for fixed value convolution synaptic filters.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.ConvSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:

    :noindex:
```

### Static Deconvolutional Synapse

This synapse performs a deconvolutional transform of its input signals.
Note that this synaptic cable does not evolve and is meant to be 
used for fixed value deconvolution/transposed convolution synaptic filters.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.DeconvSynapse

    :noindex:
```

## Multi-Factor Learning Synapse Types

Hebbian rules operate in a local manner -- they generally use information more
immediately available to synapses in both space and time -- and can come in a
wide variety of flavors. One general way to categorize variants of Hebbian learning
is to clarify what (neural) statistics they operate on, e.g, do they work with
real-valued information or discrete spikes, and how many factors (or distinct
terms) are involved in calculating the update to synaptic values by the 
relevant learning rule. <!--(Note that, in principle, all forms of plasticity in 
ngc-learn technically work like local, factor-based rules. )-->

### (Two-Factor) Hebbian Synapse

This synapse performs a linear transform of its input signals and evolves
according to a strictly two-factor update rule. In other words, the
underlying synaptic efficacy matrix is changed according to a product between
pre-synaptic compartment values (`pre`) and post-synaptic compartment (`post`)
values, which can contain any type of vector/matrix statistics.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.HebbianSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

### (Two-Factor) BCM Synapse

This synapse performs a linear transform of its input signals and evolves
according to a multi-factor, Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) update rule. The
underlying synaptic efficacy matrix is changed according to an evolved 
synaptic threshold parameter `theta` and a product between
pre-synaptic compartment values (`pre`) and a nonlinear function of post-synaptic 
compartment (`post`) values, which can contain any type of vector/matrix 
statistics.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.BCMSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

### (Two-Factor) Hebbian Convolutional Synapse

This synapse performs a convolutional transform of its input signals and evolves
according to a two-factor update rule. The underlying synaptic filters are 
changed according to products between pre-synaptic compartment values (`pre`) 
and post-synaptic compartment (`post`)  feature map values.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.HebbianConvSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

### (Two-Factor) Hebbian Deconvolutional Synapse

This synapse performs a deconvolutional (transposed convolutional) transform of 
its input signals and evolves according to a two-factor update rule. The 
underlying synaptic filters are changed according to products between 
pre-synaptic compartment values (`pre`) and post-synaptic compartment (`post`) 
feature map values.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.HebbianDeconvSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

## Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) Synapse Types

Synapses that evolve according to a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)
process operate, at a high level, much like multi-factor Hebbian rules (given
that STDP is a generalization of Hebbian adjustment to spike trains) and share
many of their properties. Nevertheless, a distinguishing factor for STDP-based
synapses is that they must involve action potential pulses (spikes) in their
calculations and they typically compute synaptic change according to the
relative timing of spikes. In principle, any of the synapses in this grouping
of components adapt their efficacies according to rules that are at least special
four-factor terms, i.e., a pre-synaptic spike (an "event"), a pre-synaptic delta
timing (which can come in the form of a trace), a post-synaptic spike (or event),
and a post-synaptic delta timing (also can be a trace). In addition, STDP rules
in ngc-learn typically enforce soft/hard synaptic strength bounding, i.e., there
is a maximum magnitude allowed for any single synaptic efficacy, and, by default,
an STDP synapse enforces that its synaptic strengths are non-negative.

### Trace-based STDP

This is a four-factor STDP rule that adjusts the underlying synaptic strength
matrix via a weighted combination of long-term depression (LTD) and long-term
potentiation (LTP). For the LTP portion of the update, a pre-synaptic trace and
a post-synaptic event/spike-trigger are used, and for the LTD portion of the
update, a pre-synaptic event/spike-trigger and a post-synaptic trace are
utilized. Note that this specific rule can be configured to use different forms
of soft threshold bounding including a scheme that recovers a power-scaling
form of STDP (via the hyper-parameter `mu`).

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.TraceSTDPSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

### Exponential STDP

This is a four-factor STDP rule that directly incorporates a controllable
exponential synaptic strength dependency into its dynamics. This synapse's LTP
and LTD use traces and spike events in a manner similar to the trace-based STDP
described above.

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.ExpSTDPSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

### Event-Driven Post-Synaptic STDP Synapse

This is a synaptic evolved under a two-factor STDP rule that is driven by 
only spike events. 


```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.EventSTDPSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

### Trace-based STDP Convolutional Synapse

This is a four-factor STDP rule for convolutional synapses that adjusts the 
underlying filters via a weighted combination of long-term depression (LTD) and 
long-term potentiation (LTP). For the LTP portion of the update, a pre-synaptic 
trace and a post-synaptic event/spike-trigger are used, and for the LTD portion 
of the update, a pre-synaptic event/spike-trigger and a post-synaptic trace are
utilized. 

```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: ngclearn.components.TraceSTDPConvSynapse
  :noindex:

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: reset
    :noindex:
```

### Trace-based STDP Deonvolutional Synapse

This is a four-factor STDP rule for deconvolutional (transposed convolutional) 
synapses that adjusts the underlying filters via a weighted combination of
long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP). For the LTP portion 
of the update, a pre-synaptic trace and a post-synaptic event/spike-trigger are 
used, and for the LTD portion of the update, a pre-synaptic event/spike-trigger 
and a post-synaptic trace are utilized. 

```{eval-rst}

  .. automethod:: advance_state
    :noindex:
  .. automethod:: evolve
    :noindex:
