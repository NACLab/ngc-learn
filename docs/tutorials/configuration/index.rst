Configuration Basics
====================

This set of guides provide information about the fundamental building blocks that characterize the NGC-Learn as well
as the operation of NGC-Learn's back-end, NGC-Sim-Lib.
For end-users (experimentalists, engineers), the sections under "Building Blocks" will be most informative. For
developers, the sections under "Development Information" are recommended, particularly for advanced use-cases and
low-level development.
