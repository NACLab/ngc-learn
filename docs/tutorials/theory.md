# Theory: Cable Theory and Neural Compartments
At its core, part of ngc-learn's internal design is inspired by (neural) <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neuronal_cable_theory">cable theory </a>, where neuronal units, which are arranged in complex connectivity structures, are viewed as performing dendritic calculations (of varying complexity). In essence, a particular neuron integrates information from different input signal sources (for example, signals produced by other neurons), in often highly nonlinear ways through a complex dendritic tree.

Although modeling a complete neuronal system through the lens of cable theory is complex and intricate in of itself, ngc-learn is built with this direction in mind. ngc-learn starts with with the idea that a neuron (or a cluster of them) can be viewed as a node or nodal component -- specifically a type of "cell" component (in ngc-learn, many of these are component classes that end with the suffix `Cell`) -- and each bundle of synapses that connects pairs of nodes can be viewed as a cable  -- specifically a "synapse" component  (these component classes usually end with the suffix `Synapse` or `SynapticCable`)-- that performs some sort of transformation of its pre-synaptic signal (also treated as another component in terms of abstract simulation) and often differentiated by its form of plasticity. See the [Neurons](../modeling/neurons) specification for the base available neuronal cells and the [Synapses](../modeling/synapses) specification for the base available synaptic cables. Note that these two types of nodal components can be combined with other types such as [Input Encoders](../modeling/input_encoders) and [Operations](../modeling/other_ops) to build gradually more complex dynamical biomimetic/neuro-mimetic systems.

Each neuronal cell component/node has multiple, different (named) "compartments", which are regions or slots within the node that other nodes can deposit information/signals into. These compartments allow a node to collect information from many different connected/related nodes and then decide how to combine these different signals in order calculate its own output activity (either in the form of a rate-coded firing rate or binary spikes) using the integration logic defined within its own specific `advanceState()` function. When a biomimetic system, composed of many of these nodes/components, is simulated over a period of time (processing some form of sensory input), its underlying simulation object (the `Controller`) calls the `advanceState()` routine of each constituent node, shifting that nodes internal time by one discrete step. The order in which the node `advanceState()` routines are called is governed by "run cycles", which are defined by the experimenter at the object initialization of the controller. For example, a user might want one set of nodes to first execute their internal step logic before another set is able to -- this could be done by specifying two distinct cycles in the order desired.

As a result, many nodes, and the synaptic cables that connect them, result in a simulated
biomimetic system where each node is itself, in general, treated as a stateful computation even if we are processing inherently non-temporal data such as static images.
