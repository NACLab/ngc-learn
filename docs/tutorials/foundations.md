# Foundational Elements

In this set of tutorials/walkthroughs, we go through some of the core elements and mechanisms underlying NGC-Learn in order understand how its simulation scheme (and the nodes-and-cables system) works and to help in writing your own custom elements.

The foundational walkthroughs are organized as follows:
1. <b>[Using Model Contexts](../tutorials/foundations/context.md)</b>: This lesson goes the fundamentals of the primary simulation construct you need to set up models, the (simulation) context.
2. <b>[Understanding Processes](../tutorials/foundations/processes.md)</b>: This lesson will walk you through the basics of a command -- an essential part of building a simulation controller in ngc-learn and ngcsimlib -- and offer some useful points for designing new ones.
<!--
3. <b>[Operations](../tutorials/foundations/operations.md)</b>: Here, the basics of bundle rules, a commonly-used mechanism for crafting complex biophysical systems, will be presented.
