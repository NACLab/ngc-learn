# Lesson 4: Evolving Synaptic Efficacies

In this tutorial, we will extend a controller with three components,
two cell components connected with a synaptic cable component, to incorporate a
basic a two-factor Hebbian adjustment process.

## Adding a Learnable Synapse to a Multi-Component System

Let us start by building a controller similar to previous lessons with the one
exception that now we will trigger the synaptic connection between `a` and `b`
to adapt via a simple 2-factor Hebbian rule. This Hebbian rule will require us
to wire the output compartment of `a` to the pre-synaptic compartment of the
synapse `Wab` and the output compartment of `b` to the post-synaptic
compartment of `Wab`. This will wire in the two relevant factors needed to
compute a simple Hebbian adjustment.

We do this specifically as follows:

```python
from jax import numpy as jnp, random, jit
from ngcsimlib.context import Context
from ngcsimlib.compilers.process import Process
from ngclearn.components import HebbianSynapse, RateCell
import ngclearn.utils.weight_distribution as dist

## create seeding keys
dkey = random.PRNGKey(1234)
dkey, *subkeys = random.split(dkey, 6)

## create simple system with only one F-N cell
with Context("Circuit") as circuit:
  a = RateCell(name="a", n_units=1, tau_m=0.,
               act_fx="identity", key=subkeys[0])
  b = RateCell(name="b", n_units=1, tau_m=0.,
               act_fx="identity", key=subkeys[1])

  Wab = HebbianSynapse(name="Wab", shape=(1, 1), eta=1.,
                       sign_value=-1., weight_init=dist.constant(value=1.),
                       w_bound=0., key=subkeys[3])

  # wire output compartment (rate-coded output zF) of RateCell `a` to input compartment of HebbianSynapse `Wab`
  Wab.inputs << a.zF
  # wire output compartment of HebbianSynapse `Wab` to input compartment (electrical current j) RateCell `b`
  b.j << Wab.outputs

  # wire output compartment (rate-coded output zF) of RateCell `a` to presynaptic compartment of HebbianSynapse `Wab`
  Wab.pre << a.zF
  # wire output compartment (rate-coded output zF) of RateCell `b` to postsynaptic compartment of HebbianSynapse `Wab`
  Wab.post << b.zF

  ## create and compile core simulation commands  
  evolve_process = (Process()
                    >> a.evolve)
  circuit.wrap_and_add_command(jit(evolve_process.pure), name="evolve")

  advance_process = (Process()
                     >> a.advance_state)
  circuit.wrap_and_add_command(jit(advance_process.pure), name="advance")
  
  reset_process = (Process()
                 >> a.reset)
  circuit.wrap_and_add_command(jit(reset_process.pure), name="reset")

  ## set up non-compiled utility commands
  @Context.dynamicCommand
  def clamp(x):
    a.j.set(x)
```

Now with our simple system above created, we will now run a simple sequence
of one-dimensional "spike" data through it and evolve the synapse every time
step like so:

```python
## run some data through the dynamical system
x_seq = jnp.asarray([[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]], dtype=jnp.float32)

circuit.reset()
print("{}: Wab = {}".format(-1, Wab.weights.value))
for ts in range(x_seq.shape[1]):
  x_t = jnp.expand_dims(x_seq[0,ts], axis=0) ## get data at time t
  circuit.clamp(x_t)
  circuit.advance(t=ts*1., dt=1.)
  circuit.evolve(t=ts*1., dt=1.)
  print(" {}: input = {} ~> Wab = {}".format(ts, x_t, Wab.weights.value))

```

Your code should produce the same output (towards the bottom):

```console
-1: Wab = [[1.]]
 0: input = [1.] ~> Wab = [[2.]]
 1: input = [1.] ~> Wab = [[4.]]
 2: input = [0.] ~> Wab = [[4.]]
 3: input = [0.] ~> Wab = [[4.]]
 4: input = [1.] ~> Wab = [[8.]]
```

Notice that for every non-spike (a value of `0`), the synaptic value remains
the same (because the product of a pre-synaptic value of `0` with a post-synaptic
value of anything -- in this case, also a `0` -- is simply `0`, meaning no
change will be applied to the synapse). For every spike (a value of `1`), we
get a synaptic change equal to `dW = input * (Wab * input)`; so for the
first time-step, the weight will change according to
`W = W + eta * dW = W + dW` and `dW = 1 * (1 * 1) = 1`, whereas, for the
second time-step, `W` will be increased by `dW = 1 * (2 * 1) = 2` (yielding a
  new synaptic strength of `W = 4`).

You have now created your first plastic, evolving neuronal system.
