# Lesson 3: Building a Model

In this tutorial, we will build a simple model made up of three components:
two simple graded cells that are connected by one synaptic cable.

## Instantiating the Dynamical System as a Context

While building our dynamical system we will set up a Context and then add the three different components to it.

```python
from ngclearn import Context
from ngclearn.components import RateCell, HebbianSynapse
from ngclearn.commands import Reset, Clamp, AdvanceState
from jax import numpy as jnp, random

## create seeding keys
dkey = random.PRNGKey(1234)
dkey, *subkeys = random.split(dkey, 4)

## create simple dynamical system: a --> w_ab --> b
with Context("model") as model:
    a = RateCell(name="a", n_units=1, tau_m=0.,
                 act_fx="identity", key=subkeys[0])
    b = RateCell(name="b", n_units=1, tau_m=20.,
                 act_fx="identity", key=subkeys[1])
    Wab = HebbianSynapse(name="Wab", shape=(1, 1),
                         wInit=("constant", 1., None), key=subkeys[2])
```

Next, we will want to wire together the three components we have embedded into
our model, connecting `a` to node `b` through synaptic cable `Wab`. In
other words, this means that the output compartment of `a` must be wired to the
input compartment of transformation `Wab` and the output compartment of `Wab`
must be wired to the input compartment of `b`. In code, this is done as follows:

```python                        
    ## wire a to w_ab and wire w_ab to b
    Wab.inputs << a.zF
    b.j << Wab.outputs
```

Finally, to make our dynamical system do something for each step of simulated
time, we must append a few basic commands
(see [Understanding Commands](../foundations/commands.md) to the context.
The commands we will want, as implied by our JSON configuration that we put
together at the start of this tutorial, include a `reset` (which will
initialize the compartments within each node to their resting values,
i.e., generally zero, if they have them -- this will only end up affecting
nodes `a` and `b` since a basic synapse component like `Wab` does not have a
base/resting value), an `advance` (which moves all the nodes one step
forward in time according to their compartments' ODEs), and `clamp` (which will
allow us to insert data into particular nodes).
This is simply done with the following few lines:

```python
    ## configure desired commands for simulation object
    Reset(command_name="reset",
          components=[a, Wab, b],
          reset_name="do_reset")
    AdvanceState(command_name="advance",
                 components=[a, Wab, b])
    Clamp(command_name="clamp_data",
          components=[a],
          compartment="j",
          clamp_name="x")
```

## Running the Dynamical System's Controller

With our simple 3-component dynamical system built, we may now run it on a
simple sequence of one-dimensional real-valued numbers:

```python
## run some data through our simple dynamical system
x_seq = jnp.asarray([[1., 2., 3., 4., 5.]], dtype=jnp.float32)

model.reset(True)
for ts in range(x_seq.shape[1]):
    x_t = jnp.expand_dims(x_seq[0, ts], axis=0)  ## get data at time ts
    model.clamp_data(x_t)
    model.advance(t=ts * 1., dt=1.)
    ## naively extract simple statistics at time ts and print them to I/O
    a_out = a.zF
    b_out = b.zF
    print(" {}: a.zF = {} ~> b.zF = {}".format(ts, a_out, b_out))
```

and, assuming you place your code above in a Python script
(e.g., `run_lesson2.py`), we should obtain output in your terminal as below:

```console
$ python run_lesson2.py
 0: a.zF = [1.] ~> b.zF = [[0.05]]
 1: a.zF = [2.] ~> b.zF = [[0.15]]
 2: a.zF = [3.] ~> b.zF = [[0.3]]
 3: a.zF = [4.] ~> b.zF = [[0.5]]
 4: a.zF = [5.] ~> b.zF = [[0.75]]
```

The simple 3-component system simulated above merely transforms the input
sequence into another time-evolving series. For the curious, in your code above,
you modeled a very simple non-leaky integration of cell `b` injected with some
value produced by `a` (since `Wab = 1`, the synapses had no effect and merely
copies the value along). While node `a` is always clamped to a value as per the
clamp command call we constructed and call above (even though its time constant
was `tau_m = 0` ms, meaning that it reduces to a stateless "feedforward" cell),
b had a time constant you set to `tau_m = 20` ms. This means, as can be confirmed
by inspecting the API for `RateCell`, with your integration time constant
`dt = 1` ms:

1. at time step `ts = 0`, the value clamped to `a`, i.e., `1`, was multiplied by
   `1/20 = 0.05` and then added `b`'s internal state (which started at the value
   of `0` through the reset command called before the for-loop);
2. at step `ts = 1`, the value clamped to `a`, i.e., `2`, was multiplied by
   `0.05` (yielding `0.1`) and then added to `b`'s current state -- meaning that
   the new state becomes `0.05 + 0.1 = 0.15`;
3. at `ts = 2`, a value `3` is clamped to `a`, which is then multiplied by `0.05`
   to yield `0.15` and then added to `b`'s current state -- meaning that the new
   state is `0.15 + 0.15 = 0.3`
   and so on and so forth (`b` acts like a non-decaying recurrently additive state).
