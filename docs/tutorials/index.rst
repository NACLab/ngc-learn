Modeling Basics
===============

Lessons/tutorials go through the very basics of constructing a dynamical system in NGC-Learn, core elements and tools of neurocognitive modeling using NGC-Learn's in-built components and simulation tools, and finally providing foundational insights into how NGC-Learn and its backend, NGC-Sim-Lib, work (particularly with respect to configuration).
