Tutorial Contents
=================

Lessons/tutorials go through the very basics of constructing a dynamical system in
ngc-learn, core elements and tools of neurocognitive modeling using ngc-learn's 
in-built components and simulation tools, and finally providing foundational insights 
into how ngc-learn and its backend, ngc-sim-lib, work (particularly with respect 
to configuration).
